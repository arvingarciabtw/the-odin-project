## üìù Project Description

This project involved creating an admin dashboard layout using the CSS grid concepts and properties taught before the project lesson. Generally, I followed the [original design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) mentioned in the project instructions but made some slight tweaks with the colors, fonts, and spacings. The site is not entirely responsive (at this point, it is not yet taught), but the tasks section do resize appropriately when the browser window is resized.

## üí° Learnings

Since this project is all about grid, unsurprisingly, I learned a lot about grid! For the entire project, not a single flex container was used. It's all grid! The most interesting thing that I've applied is the `auto-fit` property, which essentially allows the tasks to fit accordingly when the browser window is resized. Apart from that, the `grid-template-areas` was very fun to use in setting the base layout of the entire dashboard.

I'm excited to see how else grid could be utilized once I reach the lessons where responsiveness is taught!
