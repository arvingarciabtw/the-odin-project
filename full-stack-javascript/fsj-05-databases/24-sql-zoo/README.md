## üìù Project Description

The [project specification](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-databases-sql-zoo) describes the general instructions in doing the project. This project simply involves going through Tutorials 0-9 in [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). This markdown file contains my answers for the tutorials.

### 0 SELECT Basics

<span>1.</span> The example uses a `WHERE` clause to show the population of 'France'. Note that strings should be in 'single quotes'. Modify it to show the population of Germany.

```sql
SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany'
```

<span>2.</span> Checking a list The word `IN` allows us to check if an item is in a list. The example shows the name and population for the countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India' and 'China'.
Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.

```sql
SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');
```

<span>3.</span> Which countries are not too small and not too big? `BETWEEN` allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000.

```sql
SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000
```

### 1 SELECT Name

<span>1.</span> You can use `WHERE name LIKE 'B%'` to find the countries that start with "B". The % is a wild-card it can match any characters. Find the country that start with Y.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE 'Y%';
```

<span>2.</span> Find the countries that end with y.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%y';
```

<span>3.</span> Luxembourg has an x - so does one other country. List them both. Find the countries that contain the letter x.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%x%';
```

<span>4.</span> Iceland, Switzerland end with land - but are there others? Find the countries that end with land.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%land';
```

<span>5.</span> Columbia starts with a C and ends with ia - there are two more like this. Find the countries that start with C and end with ia.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE 'C%ia';
```

<span>6.</span> Greece has a double e - who has a double o? Find the country that has oo in the name.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%oo%';
```

<span>7.</span> Bahamas has three a - who else? Find the countries that have three or more a in the name.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%a%a%a%';
```

<span>8.</span> India and Angola have an n as the second character. You can use the underscore as a single character wildcard. Find the countries that have "t" as the second character.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '_t%'
  ORDER BY name;
```

<span>9.</span> Lesotho and Moldova both have two o characters separated by two other characters. Find the countries that have two "o" characters separated by two others.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%o__o%';
```

<span>10.</span> Cuba and Togo have four characters names. Find the countries that have exactly four characters.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '____';
```

<span>11.</span> The capital of Luxembourg is Luxembourg. Show all the countries where the capital is the same as the name of the country. Find the country where the name is the capital city.

```sql
SELECT name
  FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE capital;
```

<span>12.</span> The capital of Mexico is Mexico City. Show all the countries where the capital has the country together with the word "City". Find the country where the capital is the country plus "City".

```sql
SELECT name
  FROM world
  WHERE capital LIKE '%City';
```

<span>13.</span> Find the capital and the name where the capital includes the name of the country.

```sql
SELECT capital, name
  FROM world
  WHERE capital LIKE CONCAT('%', name, '%');
```

<span>14.</span> Find the capital and the name where the capital is an extension of name of the country. You should include Mexico City as it is longer than Mexico. You should not include Luxembourg as the capital is the same as the country.

```sql
SELECT capital, name
  FROM world
  WHERE capital LIKE CONCAT(name, '%') AND capital > name;
```

<span>15.</span> The capital of Monaco is Monaco-Ville: this is the name Monaco and the extension is -Ville. Show the name and the extension where the capital is a proper (non-empty) extension of name of the country. You can use the SQL function `REPLACE`.

```sql
SELECT name, replace(capital, name, '')
  FROM world
  WHERE capital LIKE CONCAT(name, '%') AND capital > name;
```

### 2 SELECT from World

<span>1.</span> Observe the result of running this SQL command to show the name, continent and population of all countries.

  FROM world
  WHERE population >= 200000000;
```

<span>4.</span> Show the `name` and `population` in millions for the countries of the `continent` 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.

SELECT name, population/1000000 AS population_in_millions
  FROM world
  WHERE continent = 'South America';
```

```sql
SELECT name, population, area
  FROM world
  WHERE area > 3000000 OR population > 250000000;
```

<span>8.</span> Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area.

```sql

  WHERE
    (area > 3000000 AND population < 250000000)
      OR
    (area < 3000000 AND population > 250000000);
```

<span>9.</span> Show the `name` and `population` in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the `continent` 'South America'. Use the `ROUND` function to show the values to two decimal places. For Americas show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.

```sql
SELECT
 name,
 ROUND(population/1000000, 2) AS population_in_millions,
 ROUND(gdp/1000000000, 2) AS gdp_in_billions
  FROM world
  WHERE continent = 'South America';
```

<span>10.</span> Show the `name` and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000. Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.

SELECT id, stadium, team1, team2
  FROM game
  WHERE id = 1012;
```

<span>3.</span> Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

SELECT player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
  WHERE stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw';
```

<span>8.</span> Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany. Select goals scored only by non-German players in matches where GER was the id of either `team1` or `team2`.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
    WHERE teamid != 'GER'
    AND ((team1 != 'GER' AND team2 = 'GER') OR
         (team1 = 'GER' AND team2 != 'GER'));
```

<span>9.</span> Show `teamname` and the total number of goals scored.

```sql
SELECT teamname, COUNT(matchid)
  FROM eteam JOIN goal ON id = teamid
  GROUP BY teamname;
```

<span>10.</span> Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.

```sql
SELECT stadium, COUNT(matchid)
  FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
  GROUP BY stadium;
```

<span>11.</span> For every match involving 'POL', show the `matchid`, date and the number of goals scored.

```sql
SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(teamid)
  FROM game
    JOIN goal ON game.id = goal.matchid
    JOIN eteam ON goal.teamid = eteam.id
  WHERE ((team1 = 'POL' AND team2 != 'POL') OR
         (team1 != 'POL' AND team2 = 'POL'))
  GROUP BY matchid, mdate;
```

<span>12.</span> For every match where 'GER' scored, show `matchid`, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'.

```sql
SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(teamid)
  FROM game
    JOIN goal ON game.id = goal.matchid
    JOIN eteam ON goal.teamid = eteam.id
  WHERE teamid = 'GER'
  GROUP BY matchid, mdate;
```

<span>13.</span> List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use `CASE WHEN` which has not been explained in any previous exercises. Sort your result by `mdate`, `matchid`, `team1` and `team2`.

```sql
SELECT
  mdate,
  team1, SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
  team2, SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
  FROM game LEFT JOIN goal
    ON matchid = id
    GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;
```

<span>2.</span> Note the `INNER JOIN` misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
  FROM teacher
    INNER JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id);
```

<span>3.</span> Use a different `JOIN` so that all teachers are listed.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
  FROM teacher
    LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id);
```

<span>4.</span> Use a different `JOIN` so that all departments are listed.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
  FROM teacher
    RIGHT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id);
```

<span>5.</span> Use `COALESCE` to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'.

```sql
SELECT name, COALESCE(mobile, '07986 444 2266') FROM teacher;
```

<span>6.</span> Use the `COALESCE` function and a `LEFT JOIN` to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

```sql
SELECT teacher.name, COALESCE(dept.name, 'None')
  FROM teacher
    LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.id = dept;
```

<span>7.</span> Use `COUNT` to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(name), COUNT(mobile) FROM teacher;
```

<span>8.</span> Use `COUNT` and `GROUP BY` dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a `RIGHT JOIN` to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.

```sql
SELECT dept.name, COUNT(teacher.name) AS num_of_staff
  FROM teacher
    RIGHT JOIN dept ON dept.id = dept
    GROUP BY dept.name;
```

### 9 Self Join

<span>1.</span> How many stops are in the database?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stops;
```

<span>2.</span> Find the id value for the stop 'Craiglockhart'.

```sql
SELECT id FROM stops WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart';
```

<span>3.</span> Give the id and the name for the stops on the '4' 'LRT' service.

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM stops
  JOIN route ON route.stop = stops.id
  WHERE company = 'LRT' AND num = '4';
```

<span>4.</span> The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. Add a HAVING clause to restrict the output to these two routes.

```sql
SELECT company, num, COUNT(*) FROM route
  WHERE stop = 149 OR stop = 53
  GROUP BY company, num
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 2;
```

<span>5.</span> Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road.

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop AS a_stop, b.stop AS b_stop
  FROM route a
  JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
  WHERE a.stop = 53 AND b.stop = 149;
```

<span>6.</span> The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown. If you are tired of these places try 'Fairmilehead' against 'Tollcross'.

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name AS stop_a_name, stopb.name AS stop_b_name
  FROM route a JOIN route b ON
    (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
    JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
    JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
  WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' AND stopb.name='London Road';
```

<span>7.</span> Give a list of all the services which connect stops 115 and 137 ('Haymarket' and 'Leith').

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.company, a.num
  FROM route a
  JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
  WHERE a.stop = 115 AND b.stop = 137;
```

<span>8.</span> Give a list of the services which connect the stops 'Craiglockhart' and 'Tollcross'.

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num
  FROM route a JOIN route b ON
    (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
    JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
    JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
  WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' AND stopb.name='Tollcross';
```

<span>9.</span> Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from 'Craiglockhart' by taking one bus, including 'Craiglockhart' itself, offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT stopb.name AS name, a.company, a.num
  FROM route a JOIN route b ON
    (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
    JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
    JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
  WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart' AND a.company = 'LRT';
```

<span>10.</span> Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Lochend.
Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer, and the bus no. and company for the second bus.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.num, a.company, stopb.name ,  c.num,  c.company
  FROM route a
  JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
  JOIN ( route c JOIN route d ON (c.company = d.company AND c.num= d.num))
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
  JOIN stops stopc ON (c.stop = stopc.id)
  JOIN stops stopd ON (d.stop = stopd.id)
  WHERE  stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart'
    AND stopd.name = 'Lochend'
    AND  stopb.name = stopc.name
  ORDER BY a.num, stopb.name, c.num;
```
