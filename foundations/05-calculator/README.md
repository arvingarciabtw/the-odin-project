## üìù Project Description

In this project, I built a very simple calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The instructions for this project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). There could have been more features added to the project like accommodating for decimal places, percentages, and others but I wanted to primarily stick with the general instructions in the curriculum.

## üí° Learnings

This project was essentially a culmination of all the concepts that were learned prior to the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course of The Odin Project curriculum. Data types, variables, loops, scope, functions, DOM manipulation, and event listeners. However, I did not use arrays or objects for this project and now I'm left wondering if there were better solutions that implemented these concepts. Anyways, it was fun applying all of the concepts I've learned so far in this project!

Time to move on to the [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) path!
