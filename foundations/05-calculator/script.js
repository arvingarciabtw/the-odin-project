// --- FUNCTIONS FOR EACH OPERATION ---
// add
// subtract
// multiply
// divide
//
// Each operation (function) should consist of a number, an operator, and another number. So, there should be three variables.
//
// Create another function called operate. The argument it should receive is one of the functions above.
//
// Create the UI for each digit and operator, including =, and a display at the top where inputs will be shown
//
// Create the function(s) that populate the display when digit buttons are clicked. The content of the display (the number) should be stored in a variable
//
// Make it work. The first and second numbers should be stored, and operate() will be called when user clicks =
//
// GOTCHAS
// -- Take note of flow. Refer to TOP page.
// -- Round answers with long decimals to prevent overflow
// -- Clicking = before entering all numbers could cause bugs
// -- Clear should clear all existing data
// -- Handle edge cases (dividing by 0, etc)
// -- Take note of flow again. (e.g. 3 ++--+-+----+ 9 = 12; last operator is considered)
// -- When you have result, and clicked a digit, result should be cleared, and digit should appear on display for a NEW calculation.
