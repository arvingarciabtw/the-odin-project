    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These baked Buffalo wings are super crispy without being fried. You can
      toss them in more hot sauce if you like them spicier! They take only 10
      minutes to prep, but it's best if the wings are refrigerated for about an
      hour before baking so the coating is firm.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>20 chicken wings</li>
      <li>½ cup melted butter</li>
      <li>½ cup hot pepper sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lightly grease with cooking
        spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place flour, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt into a resealable
        plastic bag, and shake to mix. Add chicken wings, seal the bag, and toss
        until well coated with the flour mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer wings to the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate for at least
        1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        While the oven is preheating, whisk together melted butter and hot sauce
        in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip wings into butter mixture, and place back on the baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip wings and continue to
        cook until crispy on the outside and no longer pink in the center, about
        25 more minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
