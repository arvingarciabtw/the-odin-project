## üìù Project Description

In this project, I built a basic recipe website purely with HTML.

The website consists of a main index page which has links to a few recipes. The website doesn't look very pretty by the time I‚Äôve finished it but it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the purpose of this project is to build my HTML chops. This project will be potentially revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.

## üí° Learnings

As mentioned in the prior section, this project is built only with HTML. While I already have slight familiarity with web development fundamentals prior to doing this, the project was a good refresher on HTML basics such as meta tags and the difference of absolute and relative paths (admittedly I struggle with when I should or should not use `./`, a site I deployed before had an error because of pathing issues).

While the curriculum recommends using VS Code, I am actually trying to adopt Neovim as my daily driver. So, this was also a good opportunity to familiarize with Neovim and other tools like Zellij and Lazygit.
