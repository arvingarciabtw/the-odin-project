## üìù Project Description

In this project, I built a simple rock paper scissors game that is played in the browser viewport (previously in the browser console, you may refer to my commit history).

For this project, the game was first played in the browser console. The general instructions can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) if you would like to see it. After progressing slightly with the curriculum, the project was migrated from the browser console to a stylized user interface in the browser viewport. You may refer to the instructions for that [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors).

## üí° Learnings

Before even going into the coding side of things, it is worth mentioning the importance of having a [problem solving](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving) framework. In the curriculum, this is laid out as the following: understanding the problem, planning, and pseudocode. This resonated with me a lot and I took this to heart, and so I even added comments in the beginning of my script file that shows my plan and pseudocode for the project. Doing this seriously helped me a lot when it came to the actual coding, and it was smooth sailing!

Putting the JavaScript fundamentals into practice was very fun and I learned a ton doing this project. The concept that was reinforced to me the most was scope. It was great identifying when I needed to pass some variables as arguments to functions and when it was unnecessary. Also, there was a point where code was being repeated (e.g. for logging the user and computer choices), so it was really fun refactoring my code to make it more reusable!

Overall, I had a really great time doing this project and learned a lot.

**EDIT**: The above text are my learnings after I finished the first part of the rock paper scissors project. Now that I've refactored the project to use event listeners and be familiar with DOM manipulation, I can say it was a fun learning experience!

I didn't focus too much on the styling of the project since the focus of this exercise was to familiarize with DOM manipulation and learn about event listeners. It was also very refreshing to see when the previous code had all been refactored properly. It's also neat to know that minimizing the amount of event listeners used will increase performance, and so that is what I did in this project for each of the move buttons (the event listener is on the buttons container, not on each button!). An article for that concept can be found [here](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-event-delegation/).
