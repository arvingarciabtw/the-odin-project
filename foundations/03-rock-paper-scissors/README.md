## üìù Project Description

In this project, I built a simple rock paper scissors game that is played in the browser console.

For this project, there are a fair amount of instructions to be followed, so I will simply provide the link to it [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) if you would like to see it.

## üí° Learnings

Before even going into the coding side of things, it is worth mentioning the importance of having a [problem solving](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving) framework. In the curriculum, this is laid out as the following: understanding the problem, planning, and pseudocode. This resonated with me a lot and I took this to heart, and so I even added comments in the beginning of my script file that shows my plan and pseudocode for the project. Doing this seriously helped me a lot when it came to the actual coding, and it was smooth sailing!

Putting the JavaScript fundamentals into practice was very fun and I learned a ton doing this project. The concept that was reinforced to me the most was scope. It was great identifying when I needed to pass some variables as arguments to functions and when it was unnecessary. Also, there was a point where code was being repeated (e.g. for logging the user and computer choices), so it was really fun refactoring my code to make it more reusable!

Overall, I had a really great time doing this project and learned a lot.
