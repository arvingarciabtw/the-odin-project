## üìù Project Description

In this project, I built a simple landing webpage inspired from the upcoming 2025 video game [Silksong](https://hollowknightsilksong.com/).

For this project, a [design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) has to be followed. While the project provides a [spec](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png) that could be followed, it was also allowed to personalize the site by playing with the images, colors, and fonts.

## üí° Learnings

This project was a good opportunity to test how well I know my CSS fundamentals, especially flexbox. It was very fun doing the entire thing, especially when I got to personalizing the site after finishing the base layout mentioned in the design specification. However, admittedly I was itching to also make the site responsive and add some hover animations. But, I did want to stay true to the purpose of the project! Perhaps this landing page could be revisited in the future.
